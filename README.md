This project was created to convert the existing CARTA website to a github pages website to allow for easier access to the site's information on mobile devices. 

It is a work in progress, with the first step being to convert the existing content to markdown files. 

Non-flash version of their website for pulling content into markdown can be found at http://gocarta.org/alt-flash/index.php
