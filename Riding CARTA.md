CLIENT POLICY
-------------

The CARTA Care-A-Van Client Policy has been developed with the guidance of the CARTA Care-A-Van Advisory Commission for Accessible Transportation. We appreciate your cooperation in helping us provide more efficient transportation by familiarizing yourself with and following these policies. If you have any questions, comments or suggestions to make our service more accessible, please contact our office.

Clients must have a completed, approved and current ADA Eligibility Application on file at the Care-A-Van office.

One way trips are $2.50 each, $5.00 each for round trips, payable at the time of service unless other arrangements have been made with the Care-A-Van office. There is no charge for children ages 5 and under or an approved Personal Care Attendant (PCA). Children under four (4) years of age accompanying clients, must be in a client provided child restraint seat. The fares for children ages 6-15 is 50¢ one way, $1.00 round trip. All additional adult, non-escort, family members are required to pay $2.50 one way or $5.00 round trip.

Payment Policy: All clients are expected to pay their fares at the time of transportation, unless billing arrangements have been made through the Care-A-Van office. Payment should be received at the Care-A-Van office no later than thirty (30) days after receipt of the bill. If payment is not received, eligibility will be suspended until payment is made.

Clients may schedule rides up to two (2) weeks in advance.

Advance notice is requested for scheduling trips. Reservations are accepted on a next-day basis. However, Care-A-Van will make every effort to accommodate "on-demand" trips.

Care-A-Van should never be used for emergency medical trips.

Clients are requested to be ready for pick up fifteen (15) minutes before the scheduled pick-up time and fifteen (15) minutes after the scheduled pick-up time.

Due to the high volume of riders, drivers are normally only permitted to wait for five (5) minutes after the scheduled pick­up time for the client to board the vehicle before leaving the pick-up location. However, you should contact the dispatcher if you are experiencing delays to see if arrangements can be made.

Care-A-Van service is a "curb-to-curb" service. However, Care-A-Van drivers will assist clients aboard the vehicle whenever possible. Drivers may assist clients in and out of wheelchairs only to the extent which allows the client to travel to the van and the necessary assistance to step aboard the van or transfer into a van seat.

Drivers are not allowed to enter a client's residence.

Vehicles will not enter any area where, in the driver's opinion, unsafe conditions exist for the client or damage may occur to the vehicle or personal property; for example, narrow driveways less than 16 feet wide, steep hills or slopes greater than 8.33% (1" in 12"), places where the lift ramp cannot be safely deployed on flat surfaces, no turnaround space, unpaved, rough or soft surfaces, low overhangs (less than 10'+ top clearance), etc. The drivers are not allowed to enter any area where they have to back the vehicle into or out of a client's pick-up or drop-off location. If your pick-up or drop-off location is affected by this policy, the Care-A-Van staff will work with you to arrange an alternative pick-up or drop-off location.

Clients must provide their own wheelchairs and/or mobility devices. Each mobility device must be secured in the vehicle with a four-point, tie-down and lap-belt system. Seatbelts are strongly recommended for ambulatory passengers.

Clients are only allowed to stand at their own risks.

Clients who use wheelchairs are responsible for providing safe, sturdy, non-skid, surface ramps (built according to regulations, one inch of fall to 12 inches of length).

Family members or friends must assist clients if no ramp is available. Drivers are not allowed to lower or pull up a wheelchair more than one step of regular height (7-8") due to the risk of injury to the client and/or driver.

If a client needs to cancel a ride, he/she must do so by calling the dispatcher at the Care-A-Van office before the van arrives, or else the client will be charged with a No Show for the trip. After each occurrence of a client having a "No Show" he/she will receive a letter recording the No Show and warning that if there are three (3) such occurrences within a thirty (30) day period, his/her ridership may be temporarily suspended.

If a client requires a Personal Care Attendant (escort), the client is responsible for providing such escort. The escort may ride at no charge, but the escort must be picked up at the client's location and dropped off at the same destination as the client.

Clients may not alter a scheduled destination after pick up unless previously cleared with the dispatcher. Stops between pick-up and drop-off locations are not permitted unless previously scheduled with the dispatcher. Clients who are on the call back schedule are expected to be at the arranged pick-up location.

Drivers are not permitted to carry packages or groceries. Clients are only allowed those packages which they or their escorts can carry. Travel luggage is permitted.

No pets are allowed unless they are service animals.

No smoking is allowed on the vehicles at any time.

No eating is allowed on the vehicles.

No abusive physical or verbal behavior toward the drivers or other passengers will be tolerated. Such occurrences may result in an offending client being permanently suspended from riding.

For the health of the clients and the welfare of fellow passengers, good personal hygiene is required at all times. Violations of this policy may result in suspension of ridership privileges.

Care-A-Van is a public transit service, not a personal limousine service. Due to the heavy volume of clients wishing to ride, it may be necessary to combine your trip along with several other clients. We will make every effort to accommodate your trip in the most timely and efficient manner possible without subjecting any client to an extended travel time or waiting period.

We ask your patience and for you to be aware that our vehicles are subject to the same traffic conditions and road hazards which cause traffic delays and detours for private vehicles, and may delay our schedules beyond our control.

ADVISORY COMMISSION
-------------------

The CARTA Care-A-Van Advisory Commission for Accessible Transportation consists of 19 individuals who represent consumers, advocates and agencies in the community. The Advisory Commission works in an advisory and cooperative capacity with CARTA and consumers.

The Commission meets monthly to advise, innovate and effect changes for the on going transit benefits of the disabled populace of the greater Chattanooga Area and serve as an appeals board for CARTA as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The Commission's perpetual objective is to improve the quality of life and independence for people with disabilities through accessible transportation.

BIKES ON BUSES
--------------

The CARTA has bike racks on all of its buses, excluding the Downtown Shuttle. The bike racks were made possible through grants from the City of Chattanooga and the Lyndhurst Foundation. The stainless steel racks are attached to the front of the buses and can accommodate up to two bikes at a time. The devices are easy for cyclists to use and feature locking levers to secure the bikes in the racks while the buses are in motion.

Bike riders must load their own bikes in the racks and remove them from the racks. Please get [bike instructions here.](http://www.sportworks.com/) With 16 CARTA bus routes serving Chattanooga, getting around by bike and bus is now even more convenient.
